Prior to the GPS sessions I still had a sort of fuzzy understanding of git, nothing major though, just a few questions
During the GPS I guess some questions on where the branches live in the file system as well as what some commands do and why there are certain best practices are clarified
I asked my guide things like "Where do the branches live on the file system?" and "what does the -m and -b do in the git commands"
I think I just need to learn more about how it functions overall. While clarified more, I'm still fuzzy on explaining how it works
Great! I really enjoyed it
